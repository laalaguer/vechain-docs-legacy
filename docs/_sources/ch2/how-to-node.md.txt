# How to deploy a VeChainThor node
VeChainThor blockchain's source code is open source in the [Thor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vechain/thor), free to download and compile following the deployment guide. However, you can deploy a VeChainThor node using the following methods:

* [Source code](doc:dea-thor-source-code-import-document-1) 
* [Docker](doc:docker) 
* [AWS](doc:aws) 

VeChainThor blockchain uses Proof of Authority consensus ("PoA"), therefore only 101 Authority Masternodes on VeChainThor blockchain are able to produce blocks. However, anyone can deploy a VeChainThor node and synchronize the entire blockchain ledger. To become an Authority Masternode operator one needs to go through strict KYC and submit the application for the Foundation and Steering Committee's approval. Applications can be submitted on the [VeChain Portal](https://portal.vechain.com).
