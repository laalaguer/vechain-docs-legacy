As the key enabler of the VeChain ecosystem, we built the turnkey solutions which are basic components of many blockchain solutions and make them available for developers and enterprises in the ecosystem to leverage. VeChain Turnkey Solutions are designed to work with the VeChainThor blockchain.

VeChain accumulated a lot of experiences in building blockchain solutions for enterprises in the past few years. We feel it is critical for VeChain as the key enabler of the ecosystem to share the experiences with ecosystem builders. Therefore we standardized some of our blockchain solutions and hope developers or enterprises in the ecosystem could leverage them to build products of their own on the VeChainThor blockchain. Installing turnkey solutions can give your business the extra boost it needs to function more efficiently and get a leg up over the competition. Benefits of turnkey solutions include:
* Reference design
* Reduce Time to Market
* Reduce Cost
* Boost ecosystem

Our turnkey solutions have been proven in the production environment and contain a combination of hardware and software working seamlessly on the VeChainThor blockchain.
