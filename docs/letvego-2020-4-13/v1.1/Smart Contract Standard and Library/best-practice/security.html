## Reentrancy</p>
<p>One of the major dangers of [calling external contracts](<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-external-calls">https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-external-calls</a>) is that they can take over the control flow, and make changes to your data that the calling function wasn’t expecting. This class of bug can take many forms, and both of the major bugs that led to the DAO’s collapse were bugs of this sort.</p>
<p>### Reentrancy on a Single Function</p>
<p>The first version of this bug to be noticed involved functions that could be called repeatedly, before the first invocation of the function was finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in destructive ways.</p>
<p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">``</span></a><a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">`</span></a>sol
// INSECURE
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private userBalances;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function withdrawBalance() public {</dt>
<dd>uint256 amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
// At this point, the caller’s code is executed, and can call withdrawBalance again
require(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)());
userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Since the user’s balance is not set to 0 until the very end of the function, the second (and later) invocations will still succeed, and will withdraw the balance over and over again.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>!!! Factoid</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Its goal is to codify the rules and decisionmaking apparatus of an organization, eliminating the need for documents and people in governing, creating a structure with decentralized control.</p>
<p>On June 17th 2016, [The DAO](<a class="reference external" href="https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists">https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists</a>) was hacked and 3.6 million Ether ($50 Million) were stolen using the first reentrancy attack.</p>
<p class="last">Ethereum Foundation issued a critical update to rollback the hack. This resulted in Ethereum being forked into Ethereum Classic and Ethereum.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the example given, the best mitigation method is to [use <cite>send()</cite> instead of <cite>call.value()()</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-use-caution-when-making-external-calls">https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-use-caution-when-making-external-calls</a>). This will limit any external code from being executed.</p>
<p>However, if you can’t remove the external call, the next simplest way to prevent this attack is to make sure you don’t call an external function until you’ve done all the internal work you need to do:</p>
<p><a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">``</span></a><a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">`</span></a>sol
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private userBalances;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function withdrawBalance() public {</dt>
<dd>uint256 amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
// The user’s balance is already 0, so future invocations won’t withdraw anything
require(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)());</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id10">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Note that if you had another function which called <cite>withdrawBalance()</cite>, it would be potentially subject to the same attack, so you must treat any function which calls an untrusted contract as itself untrusted. See below for further discussion of potential solutions.</p>
<p>### Cross-function Reentrancy</p>
<p>An attacker may also be able to do a similar attack using two different functions that share the same state.</p>
<p><a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">``</span></a><a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">`</span></a>sol
// INSECURE
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private userBalances;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) {</dt>
<dd><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>if (userBalances[msg.sender] &gt;= amount) {</dt>
<dd>userBalances[to] += amount;
userBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="last">}</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function withdrawBalance() public {</dt>
<dd>uint256 amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
// At this point, the caller’s code is executed, and can call transfer()
require(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)());
userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id15">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id15" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this case, the attacker calls <cite>transfer()</cite> when their code is executed on the external call in <cite>withdrawBalance</cite>. Since their balance has not yet been set to 0, they are able to transfer the tokens even though they already received the withdrawal. This vulnerability was also used in the DAO attack.</p>
<p>The same solutions will work, with the same caveats. Also note that in this example, both functions were part of the same contract. However, the same bug can occur across multiple contracts, if those contracts share state.</p>
<p>## Pitfalls in Reentrancy Solutions</p>
<p>Since reentrancy can occur across multiple functions, and even multiple contracts, any solution aimed at preventing reentrancy with a single function will not be sufficient.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>we have recommended finishing all internal work (ie. state changes) first, and only then calling the external function</strong>. This rule, if followed carefully, will allow you to avoid vulnerabilities due to reentrancy. However, you need to not only avoid calling external functions too soon, but also avoid calling functions which call external functions. For example, the following is insecure:</p>
<p><a href="#id16"><span class="problematic" id="id17">``</span></a><a href="#id18"><span class="problematic" id="id19">`</span></a>sol
// INSECURE
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private userBalances;
mapping (address =&gt; bool) private claimedBonus;
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private rewardsForA;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function withdrawReward(address recipient) public {</dt>
<dd>uint256 amountToWithdraw = rewardsForA[recipient];
rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;
require(recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)());</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function getFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public {</dt>
<dd><p class="first">require(!claimedBonus[recipient]); // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once</p>
<p class="last">rewardsForA[recipient] += 100;
withdrawReward(recipient); // At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again.
claimedBonus[recipient] = true;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id20">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id20" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Even though <cite>getFirstWithdrawalBonus()</cite> doesn’t directly call an external contract, the call in <cite>withdrawReward()</cite> is enough to make it vulnerable to a reentrancy. You therefore need to treat <cite>withdrawReward()</cite> as if it were also untrusted.</p>
<p><a href="#id21"><span class="problematic" id="id22">``</span></a><a href="#id23"><span class="problematic" id="id24">`</span></a>sol
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private userBalances;
mapping (address =&gt; bool) private claimedBonus;
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private rewardsForA;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function untrustedWithdrawReward(address recipient) public {</dt>
<dd>uint256 amountToWithdraw = rewardsForA[recipient];
rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;
require(recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)());</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public {</dt>
<dd><p class="first">require(!claimedBonus[recipient]); // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once</p>
<p class="last">claimedBonus[recipient] = true;
rewardsForA[recipient] += 100;
untrustedWithdrawReward(recipient); // claimedBonus has been set to true, so reentry is impossible</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id25">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id25" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In addition to the fix making reentry impossible, [untrusted functions have been marked](<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-mark-untrusted-contracts">https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-mark-untrusted-contracts</a>). This same pattern repeats at every level: since <cite>untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()</cite> calls <cite>untrustedWithdrawReward()</cite>, which calls an external contract, you must also treat <cite>untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()</cite> as insecure.</p>
<p>Another solution often suggested is a [mutex](<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion</a>). This allows you to “lock” some state so it can only be changed by the owner of the lock. A simple example might look like this:</p>
<p><a href="#id26"><span class="problematic" id="id27">``</span></a><a href="#id28"><span class="problematic" id="id29">`</span></a>sol
// Note: This is a rudimentary example, and mutexes are particularly useful where there is substantial logic and/or shared state
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private balances;
bool private lockBalances;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function deposit() public payable {</dt>
<dd>require(!lockBalances);
lockBalances = true;
balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
lockBalances = false;</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function withdraw(uint256 amount) public payable {</dt>
<dd><p class="first">require(!lockBalances &amp;&amp; amount &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; balances[msg.sender] &gt;= amount);
lockBalances = true;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>if (msg.sender.call(amount)()) { // Normally insecure, but the mutex saves it</dt>
<dd>balances[msg.sender] -= amount;</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
<p class="last">lockBalances = false;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id30">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id30" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If the user tries to call <cite>withdraw()</cite> again before the first call finishes, the lock will prevent it from having any effect. This can be an effective pattern, but it gets tricky when you have multiple contracts that need to cooperate. The following is insecure:</p>
<p><a href="#id31"><span class="problematic" id="id32">``</span></a><a href="#id33"><span class="problematic" id="id34">`</span></a>sol
// INSECURE
contract StateHolder {</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>uint256 private n;
address private lockHolder;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function getLock() public {</dt>
<dd>require(lockHolder == address(0));
lockHolder = msg.sender;</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function releaseLock() public {</dt>
<dd>require(msg.sender == lockHolder);
lockHolder = address(0);</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function set(uint256 newState) public {</dt>
<dd>require(msg.sender == lockHolder);
n = newState;</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id35">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id35" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>An attacker can call <cite>getLock()</cite>, and then never call <cite>releaseLock()</cite>. If they do this, then the contract will be locked forever, and no further changes will be able to be made. If you use mutexes to protect against reentrancy, you will need to carefully ensure that there are no ways for a lock to be claimed and never released. (There are other potential dangers when programming with mutexes, such as deadlocks and livelocks. You should consult the large amount of literature already written on mutexes, if you decide to go this route.)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>##  Front-Running (AKA Transaction-Ordering Dependence)</p>
<p>Above were examples of reentrancy involving the attacker executing malicious code <em>within a single transaction</em>. The following are a different type of attack inherent to Blockchains: the fact that <em>the order of transactions themselves</em> (e.g. within a block) is easily subject to manipulation.</p>
<p>Since a transaction is in the mempool for a short while, one can know what actions will occur before it is included in a block. This can be troublesome for things like decentralized markets, where a transaction to buy some tokens can be seen, and a market order implemented before the other transaction gets included. Protecting against this is difficult, as it would come down to the specific contract itself. For example, in markets, it would be better to implement batch auctions (this also protects against high frequency trading concerns). Another way to use a pre-commit scheme (“I’m going to submit the details later”).</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>## Timestamp Dependence
Be aware that the timestamp of the block can be manipulated by the miner, and all direct and indirect uses of the timestamp should be considered.</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>Note</strong>: See the [Recommendations](<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-timestamp-dependence">https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-timestamp-dependence</a>) section for design considerations related to Timestamp Dependence.</p>

<p>## Integer Overflow and Underflow</p>
<p>Consider a simple token transfer:</p>
<p><a href="#id36"><span class="problematic" id="id37">``</span></a><a href="#id38"><span class="problematic" id="id39">`</span></a>sol
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) public balanceOf;</p>
<p>// INSECURE
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public {</p>
<blockquote>
<div>/* Check if sender has balance <em>/
require(balanceOf[msg.sender] &gt;= _value);
/</em> Add and subtract new balances <a href="#id40"><span class="problematic" id="id41">*</span></a>/
balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
balanceOf[_to] += _value;</div></blockquote>
<p>}</p>
<p>// SECURE
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public {</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>/* Check if sender has balance and for overflows <a href="#id42"><span class="problematic" id="id43">*</span></a>/
require(balanceOf[msg.sender] &gt;= _value &amp;&amp; balanceOf[_to] + _value &gt;= balanceOf[_to]);</p>
<p>/* Add and subtract new balances <a href="#id44"><span class="problematic" id="id45">*</span></a>/
balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
balanceOf[_to] += _value;</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id46">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id46" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If a balance reaches the <em>maximum uint256 value (2^256)</em> it will circle back to zero which checks for the condition. This may or may not be relevant, depending on the implementation. Think about whether or not the <cite>uint</cite> value has an opportunity to approach such a large number. Think about how the <cite>uint</cite> variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the <cite>uint</cite> value, it’s more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable’s state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.</p>
<p>The same is true for underflow. If a uint256 is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value.</p>
<p>Be careful with the smaller data-types like uint8, uint16, uint24…etc: they can even more easily hit their maximum value.</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>Warning</strong>: Be aware there are around [20 cases for overflow and underflow](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/796#issuecomment-253578925">https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/796#issuecomment-253578925</a>).</p>
<p>One simple solution to mitigate the common mistakes for overflow and underflow is to use <cite>SafeMath.sol</cite> [library](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol">https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol</a>) for arithmetic functions.</p>

<p>In general, the variable <cite>manipulateMe</cite>’s location cannot be influenced without going through the <cite>keccak256</cite>, which is infeasible. However, since dynamic arrays are stored sequentially, if a malicious actor wanted to change <cite>manipulateMe</cite> all they would need to do is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Call <cite>popBonusCode</cite> to underflow (Note: <cite>array.pop()</cite> method [was added](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.5.0/Changelog.md">https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.5.0/Changelog.md</a>) in Solidity 0.5.0)</li>
<li>Compute the storage location of <cite>manipulateMe</cite></li>
<li>Modify and update <cite>manipulateMe</cite>’s value using <cite>modifyBonusCode</cite></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&gt; <strong>Note</strong>: In practice, this array would be immediately pointed out as fishy, but buried under more complex smart contract architecture, it can arbitrarily allow malicious changes to constant variables, such as total supply of a token.</p>
<p>When considering use of a dynamic array, a container data scructure is a good practice. The Solidity CRUD [part 1](<a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;robhitchens/solidity-crud-part-1-824ffa69509a">https://medium.com/&#64;robhitchens/solidity-crud-part-1-824ffa69509a</a>) and [part 2](<a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;robhitchens/solidity-crud-part-2-ed8d8b4f74ec">https://medium.com/&#64;robhitchens/solidity-crud-part-2-ed8d8b4f74ec</a>) articles are good resources.</p>

<p>## DoS with (Unexpected) revert</p>
<p>Consider a simple auction contract:</p>
<p><a href="#id52"><span class="problematic" id="id53">``</span></a><a href="#id54"><span class="problematic" id="id55">`</span></a>sol
// INSECURE
contract Auction {</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>address currentLeader;
uint256 highestBid;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function bid() public payable {</dt>
<dd><p class="first">require(msg.value &gt; highestBid);</p>
<p>require(currentLeader.send(highestBid)); // Refund the old leader, if it fails then revert</p>
<p class="last">currentLeader = msg.sender;
highestBid = msg.value;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id56">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id56" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If attacker bids using a smart contract which has a fallback function that reverts any payment, the attacker can win any auction. When it tries to refund the old leader, it reverts if the refund fails. This means that a malicious bidder can become the leader while making sure that any refunds to their address will <em>always</em> fail. In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the <cite>bid()</cite> function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a [pull payment system](<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls">https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls</a>) instead, as described earlier.</p>
<p>Another example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It’s common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete. No one gets paid because one address is forcing an error.</p>
<p><a href="#id57"><span class="problematic" id="id58">``</span></a><a href="#id59"><span class="problematic" id="id60">`</span></a>sol
address[] private refundAddresses;
mapping (address =&gt; uint256) public refunds;</p>
<p>// bad
function refundAll() public {</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>// arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated
for(uint256 x = 0; x &lt; refundAddresses.length; x++) {</p>
<blockquote>
<div>// doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]))</div></blockquote>
<p>}</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Again, the recommended solution is to [favor pull over push payments](<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls">https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls</a>).</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>## DoS with Block Gas Limit</p>
<p>Each block has an upper bound on the amount of gas that can be spent, and thus the amount computation that can be done. This is the Block Gas Limit. If the gas spent exceeds this limit, the transaction will fail. This leads to a couple possible Denial of Service vectors:</p>
<p>### Gas Limit DoS on a Contract via Unbounded Operations</p>
<p>You may have noticed another problem with the previous example: by paying out to everyone at once, you risk running into the block gas limit.</p>
<p>This can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it’s especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker’s addresses could, therefore, end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.</p>
<p>This is another reason to [favor pull over push payments](<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls">https://doc.vechainworld.io/page/recommendations#section-favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls</a>).</p>
<p>If you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you’ve gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:</p>
<p><a href="#id62"><span class="problematic" id="id63">``</span></a><a href="#id64"><span class="problematic" id="id65">`</span></a>sol
struct Payee {</p>
<blockquote>
<div>address addr;
uint256 value;</div></blockquote>
<p>}</p>
<p>Payee[] payees;
uint256 nextPayeeIndex;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function payOut() public {</dt>
<dd><p class="first">uint256 i = nextPayeeIndex;
while (i &lt; payees.length &amp;&amp; msg.gas &gt; 200000) {</p>
<blockquote>
<div>payees[i].addr.send(payees[i].value);
i++;</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">}
nextPayeeIndex = i;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id66">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id66" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the <cite>payOut()</cite> function. So only use this pattern if absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>### Gas Limit DoS on the Network via Block Stuffing</p>
<p>Even if your contract does not contain an unbounded loop, an attacker can prevent other transactions from being included in the blockchain for several blocks by placing computationally intensive transactions with a high enough gas price.</p>
<p>To do this, the attacker can issue several transactions which will consume the entire gas limit, with a high enough gas price to be included as soon as the next block is mined. No gas price can guarantee inclusion in the block, but the higher the price is, the higher is the chance.</p>
<p>If the attack succeeds, no other transactions will be included in the block. Sometimes, an attacker’s goal is to block transactions to a specific contract prior to specific time.</p>
<p>This attack [was conducted](<a class="reference external" href="https://osolmaz.com/2018/10/18/anatomy-block-stuffing">https://osolmaz.com/2018/10/18/anatomy-block-stuffing</a>) on Fomo3D, a gambling app. The app was designed to reward the last address that purchased a “key”. Each key purchase extended the timer, and the game ended once the timer went to 0. The attacker bought a key and then stuffed 13 blocks in a row until the timer was triggered and the payout was released. Transactions sent by attacker took 7.9 million gas on each block, so the gas limit allowed a few small “send” transactions (which take 21,000 gas each), but disallowed any calls to the <cite>buyKey()</cite> function (which costs 300,000+ gas).</p>
<p>A Block Stuffing attack can be used on any contract requiring an action within a certain time period. However, as with any attack, it is only profitable when the expected reward exceeds its cost. Cost of this attack is directly proportional to the number of blocks which need to be stuffed. If a large payout can be obtained by preventing actions from other participants, your contract will likely be targeted by such an attack.</p>

<p>## Forcibly Sending VET to a Contract</p>
<p>It is possible to forcibly send VET to a contract without triggering its fallback function. This is an important consideration when placing important logic in the fallback function or making calculations based on a contract’s balance. Take the following example:</p>
<p><a href="#id67"><span class="problematic" id="id68">``</span></a><a href="#id69"><span class="problematic" id="id70">`</span></a>sol
contract Vulnerable {</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>function () payable {</dt>
<dd>revert();</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>function somethingBad() public {</dt>
<dd>require(this.balance &gt; 0);
// Do something bad</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id71">
<h1>}<a class="headerlink" href="#id71" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Contract logic seems to disallow payments to the contract and therefore disallow “something bad” from happening. However, a few methods exist for forcibly sending VET to the contract and therefore making its balance greater than zero.</p>
<p>The <cite>selfdestruct</cite> contract method allows a user to specify a beneficiary to send any excess VET. <cite>selfdestruct</cite> [does not trigger a contract’s fallback function](<a class="reference external" href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/security-considerations.html#sending-and-receiving-ether">https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/security-considerations.html#sending-and-receiving-ether</a>).</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>Warning</strong>: It is also possible to [precompute](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/tree/master/submissions-2017/ricmoo">https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/tree/master/submissions-2017/ricmoo</a>) a contract’s address and send VET to that address before deploying the contract.</p>
