Block
======

VeChainThor defines a `block <https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/master/block/block.go>`_ in Golang as:

[block:code]

{

  "codes": [

	{

	  "code": "type Block struct {\\n\\theader \*Header\\n\\ttxs    tx.Transactions\\n}\\n\\ntype Header struct {\\n\\tbody headerBody\\n}\\n\\ntype headerBody struct {\\n\\tParentID    thor.Bytes32\\n\\tTimestamp   uint64\\n\\tGasLimit    uint64\\n\\tBeneficiary thor.Address\\n\\n\\tGasUsed    uint64\\n\\tTotalScore uint64\\n\\n\\tTxsRoot      thor.Bytes32\\n\\tStateRoot    thor.Bytes32\\n\\tReceiptsRoot thor.Bytes32\\n\\n\\tSignature []byte\\n}\\n\\ntype Transactions []\*Transaction",

	  "language": "text"

	}

  ]
}

[/block]

where `ParentID` is the ID of the parent block, `Beneficiary` is the address assigned by the block generator to receive reward (in VTHO), and `TotalScore` is the accumulated witness number of the chain branch headed by the block. We will describe what the score means when describing the `Proof of Authority consensus algorithm <https://doc.vechainworld.io/docs/proof-of-authority>`_.

Let $\Gamma$ denote `headerBody`. The block ID (`thor.Bytes32`) can be computed as:

$BlkID = h \circ \big(hash\,(\Gamma-\{sig\})\big)[4:]$

where $h$ is the block number stored as a `uint32` and $[4:]$ the operation that discards the first four bytes.
