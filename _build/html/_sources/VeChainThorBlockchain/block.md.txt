# Block
VeChainThor defines a [block](https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/master/block/block.go) in Golang as:
```
    type Block struct {
          header *Headertxs    
          tx.Transactions 
    }

    type Header struct {
        body headerBody 
    }

    type headerBody struct {
        ParentID    thor.Bytes32
        Timestamp   uint64
        GasLimit    uint64
        Beneficiary thor.Address 
        GasUsed     uint64Total
        Score       uint64 
        TxsRoot     thor.Bytes32
        StateRoot    thor.Bytes32
        ReceiptsRoot thor.Bytes32 
        Signature []byte 
    }
    type Transactions []*Transaction
```

where `ParentID` is the ID of the parent block, `Beneficiary` is the address assigned by the block generator to receive reward (in VTHO), and `TotalScore` is the accumulated witness number of the chain branch headed by the block. We will describe what the score means when describing the [Proof of Authority consensus algorithm](https://doc.vechainworld.io/docs/proof-of-authority).

Let $\Gamma$ denote `headerBody`. The block ID (`thor.Bytes32`) can be computed as:

$BlkID = h \circ \big(hash\,(\Gamma-\{sig\})\big)[4:]$

where $h$ is the block number stored as a `uint32` and $[4:]$ the operation that discards the first four bytes.
