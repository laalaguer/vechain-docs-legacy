VeChainThor defines a [block](https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/master/block/block.go) in Golang as:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "type Block struct {\n\theader *Header\n\ttxs    tx.Transactions\n}\n\ntype Header struct {\n\tbody headerBody\n}\n\ntype headerBody struct {\n\tParentID    thor.Bytes32\n\tTimestamp   uint64\n\tGasLimit    uint64\n\tBeneficiary thor.Address\n\n\tGasUsed    uint64\n\tTotalScore uint64\n\n\tTxsRoot      thor.Bytes32\n\tStateRoot    thor.Bytes32\n\tReceiptsRoot thor.Bytes32\n\n\tSignature []byte\n}\n\ntype Transactions []*Transaction",
      "language": "text"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
where `ParentID` is the ID of the parent block, `Beneficiary` is the address assigned by the block generator to receive reward (in VTHO), and `TotalScore` is the accumulated witness number of the chain branch headed by the block. We will describe what the score means when describing the [Proof of Authority consensus algorithm](https://doc.vechainworld.io/docs/proof-of-authority).

Let $\Gamma$ denote `headerBody`. The block ID (`thor.Bytes32`) can be computed as:

$BlkID = h \circ \big(hash\,(\Gamma-\{sig\})\big)[4:]$

where $h$ is the block number stored as a `uint32` and $[4:]$ the operation that discards the first four bytes.
