VeChain supplies five types of IoT tags which include NFC tags as well as dual frequency tags (NFC+RFID). All tags are pre-programmed with VeChain IDs and cryptographic keys. And they are compliant with international standards such as ISO/IEC14443A and NFC Forum Standard. 

NFC tags communicate with NFC enabled devices such as smartphones to transfer data without contact. RFID tags communicate with UHF readers within the distance of 1.5m, which is useful for batch processing in inventory management. 

VeChain's passive IoT tags work seamlessly with VeChain's blockchain solutions such as ToolChain, and users can order the tags in their ToolChain web portal for delivery.
